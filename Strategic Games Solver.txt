1) Take a Matrix and get Show Dominated Strategies,Nash, Pareto, Kaldor Hicks equilibriums
1) Take a Matrix and Show the rollback  equilibrium and the equilibrium path (may have to allow for 2more than two players)
	1) maybe show path as well

Rollback Equlibrium Solver
-	Assume order will always be Player 1, then Player 2 and so on

- Add a player
- Show available strategies for each player
- Show rollback equilibrium
- Show the equilibrium path
-	Maybe grey out the invalid nodes
-	Maybe on line click, show why the node is invalid
