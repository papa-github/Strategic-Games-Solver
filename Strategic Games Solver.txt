1) Take a Matrix and get Show Dominated Strategies,Nash, Pareto, Kaldor Hicks equilibriums
1) Take a Matrix and Show the rollback  equilibrium and the equilibrium path (may have to allow for 2more than two players)
	1) maybe show path as well


Things to do
- Add steps to Mixed Nash Equilibrium
- Add steps to risk dominant equilibrium
